# Pricing model

## Model

The pricing model is based on the [ARM Pseudo-Code](https://hackmd.io/hsN-E0LgRgy7Ax2p3Ny1VA). To use the pricing
model, the following steps are necessary:

1. NFTs in the current seed data should be labeled using clustering
   algorithm ([Pooling Classifier API](api_pooling_classifier.md))
2. [Table of Pool](../data-model-ingestion.md#table-of-pool-summaries) should be defined for all the pools based on the
   seed data and
   their labels. Pricing API will use these tables to define the $X$ and $Q$ matrices used
   in [ARM Pseudo-Code](https://hackmd.io/hsN-E0LgRgy7Ax2p3Ny1VA).
3. The incoming NFTs for pricing must be labeled using the clustering
   model ([Pooling Classifier API](api_pooling_classifier.md))
4. NFTs with the same label should form a request to ARMM. For each request to ARMM, Pricing API will define $\Delta q$
   used in [ARM Pseudo-Code](https://hackmd.io/hsN-E0LgRgy7Ax2p3Ny1VA)

Based on the [Input Parameters](pricing-api.md#input-parameters), Pricing API will define the minimum recommended price
as the maximum price that [ARMM](https://hackmd.io/hsN-E0LgRgy7Ax2p3Ny1VA) is willing to pay for buying the NFTs,
and the maximum recommended price as the minimum price that [ARMM](https://hackmd.io/hsN-E0LgRgy7Ax2p3Ny1VA) is willing
to receive for selling the NFTs.

## Implementation

The `main.py` imports two underlying functions stored in `pricing.py`. These functions are the python implementation of
the [ARM Pseudo-Code](https://hackmd.io/hsN-E0LgRgy7Ax2p3Ny1VA).
Particularly, `arm_buys_price` returns the max price that ARMM is willing to buy the NFTs for, and `arm_sells_price`
returns the min price that ARMM is willing to sell the NFTs for. The `main` function returns these prices respectively
as the minimum and maximum recommended prices.

Additionally, `pricing.py` contains `eigenvalues_calculator` function that requires $X$ and $Q$ or $Q + \Delta q$ as
inputs, and returns the eigenvalues of $XQX^T$ or $X(Q + Î”q)X^T$.

## Inputs and outputs

```
    :param pool_id: pool id of NFTs to be priced
    :param n_nft: number of NFTs in the current call
    :param pool_meta: the metadata of all pools
    :param r: quantity of a reserve currency in USD cents

    :return: dictionary with min and max recommended prices
```


### Python Sample Run
```
cd <your-path>/hem-armm-engineering/hem/armm/pricing
python ./main.py cc251a50-a1ac-4ddc-92a8-2bdb57df29ab 20 ../clusterin/data/pool_meta.json 10000000
```
this code calculates the price per nft for the `20` NFTs from pool `cc251a50-a1ac-4ddc-92a8-2bdb57df29ab` 
using the pool meta `hem-armm-engineering/hem/armm/clustering/data/pool_meta.json` with the assumption of having `10000000` USD cents reserves, and saves a 
json file with the minimum and maximum recommended prices.
